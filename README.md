My Email Signature
===============

Seriously! It's just an email signature!

License: You are welcome to use this email signature assuming the following...

* You change/amend the name (full name)
* You change/amend the projects
* You change/amend every link within the signature (format: "<a href="link">link content</a> <b>*</b>)

<p>*: This is ridiculous I have to define this, but to be sure! :)</p>

Notes:
* Disclaimer modified. Original by http://www.emaildisclaimers.com/Sample_disclaimers.htm#Liability

TL;DR: You are only really allowed to use the signature formatting template (css, basic html) and not any actual content pertaining to myself.
